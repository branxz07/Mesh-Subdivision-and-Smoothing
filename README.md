# Mesh Subdivision and Smoothing

This project provides a Python script for reading, subdividing, and applying Laplacian smoothing to 3D mesh models in OBJ format. The script uses the `trimesh` library for handling 3D meshes and `numpy` for numerical operations.

## Features

- **OBJ File Reading**: Reads vertices and faces from an OBJ file.
- **Face Subdivision**: Subdivides the faces of a mesh while ensuring no duplicate vertices.
- **Laplacian Smoothing**: Applies Laplacian smoothing to the vertices of a mesh to create a smoother surface.
- **Visualize and Download**: Shows the final result after the subdivision and smoothing, and downloads the new OBJ.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- `numpy`
- `trimesh`

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/branxz07/Mesh-Subdivision-and-Smoothing.git
    cd Mesh-Subdivision-and-Smoothing
    ```

2. Install the required packages:
    ```sh
    pip install numpy trimesh
    ```

## Usage

1. Place your OBJ file in the project directory. For example, `pumpkin_tall_10k.obj`.

2. Update the `objPath` variable in the script to the name of your OBJ file:
    ```python
    objPath = 'pumpkin_tall_10k.obj'
    ```

3. Run the script:
    ```sh
    python mesh_subdivision_and_smoothing.py
    ```

4. The script will generate a new OBJ file with the subdivided and smoothed mesh, named `Sub.obj` by default.

## Example

```python
# Path to the input OBJ file
objPath = 'pumpkin_tall_10k.obj'

# Read the OBJ file
vertices, faces = readObj(objPath)

# Subdivide the faces
subVertex, subFaces = subdivideFaces(vertices, faces)

# Apply Laplacian smoothing
smoothed_vertices = apply_laplacian_smoothing(subVertex, subFaces)

# Create a new mesh with smoothed vertices and subdivided faces
newObj = trimesh.Trimesh(vertices=smoothed_vertices, faces=subFaces)

# Path to the output OBJ file
output_file = 'Sub.obj'

# Export the new mesh to an OBJ file
newObj.export(output_file)

# Display the new mesh
newObj.show()

```
